## Google Cloud Platform Questions
### Why can't I sign up with my Gmail account?

As your institution gives you a personal institutional email address, they also manage the access to this account. By using your institutional email address, we have the guarantee that you are acting as a representative of your institution and that your access will be revoked in case of, for example, termination of your contract.
